# ***Car-Price-Prediction-Model***
Course Code: ITS08PR2 

Course: Machine Learning I

Semester II

Utilized Machine Learning Regression Algorithms to build a Car Price Prediction Model.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meruvulikith/90000-cars-data-from-1970-to-2024

Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, ElasticNet, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost

After fine-tuning and optimizing model performance, XGBoost achieved a high R-squared score of 0.937729.

Performed: Data Cleaning, Pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis, and K-means Clustering to aid Feature Engineering. Application and understanding of real-world implications of the data and domain knowledge was required to build the model.

Features Included:


Model: The model of the car.
- Year: The manufacturing year of the car.
- Price: The price of the car.
- Transmission: The type of transmission used in the car.
- Mileage: The mileage of the car.
- FuelType: The type of fuel used by the car.
- Tax: The tax rate applicable to the car.
- MPG: The miles per gallon efficiency of the car.
- EngineSize: The size of the car's engine.
- Manufacturer: The manufacturer of the car.
